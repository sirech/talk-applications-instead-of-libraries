# A Challenge

---

## Let's start with a question

---

## How to distribute front end applications?

---

### Using an npm package

## You can guess that it didn't quite work

## Challenges

<h3 class="fragment fade-up">
Consistency
</h3>

<h3 class="fragment fade-up">
Rolling updates
</h3>

<h3 class="fragment fade-up">
Operability
</h3>

# What is module federation?

---

## Load modules remotely

---

## New in Webpack 5

---

## Why is that relevant?

---

## Low friction integration between independent applications

## With great power ...

# Consuming a Remote Application

## A problem
### Dynamic loading

## A more flexible loading

# Shared Dependencies

---

---

## You don't want to download React multiple times

---

## You don't want strong coupling, either

---

(maybe?) dependency resolution in module federation

# Beyond Single Components

---

## Keeping internal state private


---

code snippet: internal context

---

## Interactions between host and remote applications

---

code snippet: shared provider

---

## X-Cutting concerns
### Logging
### Monitoring
### i18n

---

## A funky experiment
### Configurable remote applications

# Scaling Usage

## What if you have multiple remote applications?

# Encouraging Adoption

---

## Should we build our new application as a micro frontend?

---

## It depends!

## Finding meaningful boundaries is **hard**!
